Step 1: Install Git
Download Git from git-scm.com (Windows/Mac/Linux).

Install it (just keep clicking "Next" with default settings).

Verify installation by opening Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux) and running:

sh
git --version
(If you see a version number like git version 2.40.0, itâ€™s installed!)

Step 2: Set Up Git (One-Time Setup)
Run these commands in your terminal (replace with your GitHub email/username):

sh
git config --global user.name "Your GitHub Username"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
Step 3: Connect Your Local Files to GitHub
Go to your project folder (where your HTML/CSS/JS files are).

Right-click the folder and select "Open in Terminal" (or cd into it manually).

Initialize Git (creates a hidden .git folder to track changes):

sh
git init
Link to your GitHub repo:

Go to your GitHub repository, click "Code" (green button), and copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git).

Run this in the terminal (replace with your URL):

sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Step 4: Upload Your Files
Stage all files (prepares them for upload):

sh
git add .
(The . means "all files." You can also use git add index.html for specific files.)

Commit the changes (like saving a snapshot with a message):

sh
git commit -m "First website upload"
Push to GitHub (uploads files to your repo):

sh
git push -u origin main
If you get an error, try git push -u origin master (older repos use master).

If asked, log in with your GitHub username/password (or a Personal Access Token if 2FA is enabled).
................................................
Professional Way (Using Git Commands)
Clone the Repository (if you haven't already):

sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Make Your Changes Locally:

Replace the old files with your updated files (HTML, CSS, JS).

Or modify the existing files.

Check the Changes:

sh
git status
(This will show which files were modified/added/deleted.)

Stage All Changes:

sh
git add .
(Or selectively add files using git add filename)

Commit the Changes:

sh
git commit -m "Updated website with new design and functionality"
Push to GitHub:

sh
git push origin main
(Replace main with your branch name if different.)
......................................................
When You made changes locally:
git add .
git commit -m "Updated navbar and colors"
git push origin main
if "git push origin main" does not work
then
git push -u origin master
